# ComputerVisionNotebook
 
This project leverages computer vision and hand tracking technologies to create an interactive drawing application. Developed with Python, it utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking, enabling users to draw on their screen with hand gestures. This versatile module can be integrated into various educational, creative, and accessibility-driven applications.

## Features

- Real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition
- Drawing on screen with hand movements
- Easy integration into other projects
- Customizable hand tracking parameters

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`) --any v
- MediaPipe (`mediapipe`) 0.10.9

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DeboJp/ComputerVisionNotebook.git
cd ComputerVisionNotebook
pip install opencv-python mediapipe Pillow reportlab
```

## Use Cases
Educational Tools: Enhance interactive learning experiences by integrating gesture-based interactions.
Creative Arts: Allow artists to draw or manipulate digital media through hand movements.
Accessibility: Develop assistive technologies for individuals with mobility impairments or finantial constrainsts allowing the use of their cameras for teaching or notetaking.
Just for Fun: Create an overlay and take a screenshot/selfie for fun with friends :)

## QuickStart
1. Two fingers for Selection
2. Thumb and Index together for pointer
3. index finger high(seperate from thumb and middle) to draw freely - switch between indexthumb and index to track more freely.
4. Hover over any of the above options to clear, erase, choose color, save pictures temp, save temp into pdf.
5. Have FUn!

## Demo
- Just sketching (There is a blooper at the end----ooouu!) <br>
